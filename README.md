#HI

This is a project based on the calutor works

We are getting the input as strings 

We are splitting the datas to find the operation type
  Add
  Sub
  Mul
  Div

Then we care converting it to float based variable 

Thus the arithmetic opertaions are more to be based on decimal to make it accurate or precise
