# String Calculator

This project is a simple calculator implementation that operates on strings, focusing on basic arithmetic operations. The input is provided as strings, and the program determines the operation type through string splitting. The supported operations include:

- Addition (Add)
- Subtraction (Sub)
- Multiplication (Mul)
- Division (Div)

The string input is then converted into float-based variables, allowing for decimal values to enhance precision and accuracy in arithmetic calculations.

## Usage

To use the calculator, provide input strings in the following format:

```python
calculator.calculate("num1 operation num2")
```

Replace "num1" and "num2" with the numerical values you want to operate on and "operation" with one of the supported operations.

Example:

```python
result = calculator.calculate("5.2 + 3.8")
print(result)  # Output: 9.0
```

## Testing

Testing has been implemented to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the calculator. The following test cases are included:

- Addition Test (AddTest)
- Subtraction Test (SubTest)
- Multiplication Test (MulTest)
- Division Test (DivTest)
