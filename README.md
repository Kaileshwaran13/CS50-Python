# CS50 Final Project

### HI

This is a project based on the how calculator works and basic arithmetic operations 

We are getting the input as strings 

We are splitting the datas to find the operation type

  - Add
  
  - Sub
  
  - Mul
  
  - Div

Then we are converting the string data to float based variable 

The decimal values are used to make the arithmetic program more precise and accurate.

Testing is also done for this project for used models each.

  - Add
  
  - Sub
  
  - Mul
  
  - Div
