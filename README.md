# CS50 Final Project

### HI

This is a project based on how calculator works and basic arithmetic operations 

We are getting the input as strings 

We are splitting the data to find the operation type

  - Add
  
  - Sub
  
  - Mul
  
  - Div

Then we convert the string data to float based variable 

The decimal values are used to make the arithmetic program more precise and accurate.

Testing is also done for this project for used models.

  - AddTest
  
  - SubTest
  
  - MulTest
  
  - DivTest
