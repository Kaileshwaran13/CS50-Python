# CS50 Final Project

### HI

This is a project based on the how calculator works

We are getting the input as strings 

We are splitting the datas to find the operation type
  - Add
  
  - Sub
  
  - Mul
  
  - Div

Then we are converting it to float based variable 

Thus the arithmetic opertaions are more to be based on decimal to make it accurate or precise

Testing is also done for this project.
